    <p>This is the first paragraph. I'm trying to see if I can take existing file on my laptop and add them to github.</p>
    <p>After that I want to see if I can <strong>remove</strong> that repository from github desktop so that it's like my website. Then add it to the desktop app and see if it will do anything to the files on my laptop.</p>
